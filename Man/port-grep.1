.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Port-grep
searches a file (Makefile by default) of every port in the
tree for "pattern" using the standard grep(1) command.
The grep command can be fully controlled as normal by
supplying grep flags following "pattern".  The -f flag
tells port-grep to search "file" (e.g. pkg-plist) instead
of "Makefile".

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 on success, non-zero error codes otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na
# Search for ports maintained by jwb@
port-grep '^MAINTAINER=.*jwb@'
# Search for ports that install a program called "fasda"
port-grep -f pkg-plist bin/fasda
.ad
.fi

.SH SEE ALSO

grep(1), port-list(1), port-which(1)

Note:
Keep port-grep and pkg-grep in sync!
